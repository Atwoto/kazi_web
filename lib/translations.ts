        general: [
          { q: "What is Kazi?", a: "Kazi means 'work' in Swahili. Kazi connects skilled East African freelancers with clients in Europe. We focus on fast delivery, clear communication, and fair prices. We are a quality-controlled bridge, not a random marketplace." },
          { q: "How long does it take?", a: "Timelines vary by project. We provide a specific estimated turnaround time with every quote. For example, simple edits may take 24-48 hours, while web development takes 1-2 weeks." },
          { q: "How do revisions work?", a: "Our quotes include a set number of revision rounds (typically 2). We define clearly what counts as a revision to ensure we hit your goals without scope creep." },
          { q: "What info do you need to start?", a: "We need a clear brief: what you want, any examples of style you like, and your deadline. The more specific you are, the faster we can deliver." },
          { q: "Can I talk to the freelancer directly?", a: "No, Kazi manages delivery. To ensure quality, speed, and dispute resolution, all communication goes through your dedicated Kazi project manager." },
        ],
        payments: [
          { q: "How payments work?", a: "We use a milestone system. You pay an initial deposit to start the work, and the remaining balance is paid only when you approve the final preview. For Spain clients, we accept Bizum, bank transfer, and cards." },
          { q: "Do you offer refunds?", a: "Yes. We offer a free refund up to 5 days after completion of service if the issue is due to a freelancer error that we cannot fix." },
        ],
        privacy: [
          { q: "How do you protect confidentiality?", a: "Freelancers do not see your personal details beyond what is needed to do the job. All our talent signs strict NDAs to protect your intellectual property." },
          { q: "What happens if I disappear mid-project?", a: "If you are unresponsive for a prolonged period, we will pause the project. If we cannot reach you after multiple attempts, we reserve the right to close the project and bill for work completed to date." },

          { q: "¿Cuánto tiempo toma?", a: "Los plazos varían según el proyecto. Proporcionamos un tiempo estimado específico con cada presupuesto. Por ejemplo, ediciones simples pueden tomar 24-48 horas, mientras que el desarrollo web toma 1-2 semanas." },
          { q: "¿Cómo funcionan las revisiones?", a: "Nuestros presupuestos incluyen un número fijo de rondas de revisión (típicamente 2). Definimos claramente qué cuenta como revisión para asegurar que alcanzamos tus objetivos sin cambios de alcance." },
          { q: "¿Qué información necesitan para empezar?", a: "Necesitamos un resumen claro: qué quieres, ejemplos de estilo que te gusten y tu fecha límite. Cuanto más específico seas, más rápido podremos entregar." },
          { q: "¿Puedo hablar con el freelancer directamente?", a: "No, Kazi gestiona la entrega. Para asegurar calidad, velocidad y resolución de disputas, toda comunicación pasa a través de tu gestor de proyectos dedicado de Kazi." },

        payments: [
          { q: "¿Cómo funcionan los pagos?", a: "Usamos un sistema de hitos. Pagas un depósito inicial para comenzar el trabajo, y el saldo restante se paga solo cuando apruebas la vista previa final. Para clientes en España, aceptamos Bizum, transferencia bancaria y tarjetas." },
          { q: "¿Ofrecen reembolsos?", a: "Sí. Ofrecemos un reembolso gratuito hasta 5 días después de completar el servicio si el problema se debe a un error del freelancer que no podemos arreglar." },
        ],
        privacy: [
          { q: "¿Cómo protegen la confidencialidad?", a: "Los freelancers no ven tus datos personales más allá de lo necesario para hacer el trabajo. Todo nuestro talento firma acuerdos de confidencialidad estrictos para proteger tu propiedad intelectual." },

        general: [
          { q: "Què és Kazi?", a: "Kazi significa 'treball' en suahili. Kazi connecta freelancers qualificats de l'Àfrica Oriental amb clients a Europa. Ens enfoquem en lliurament ràpid, comunicació clara i preus justos." },
          { q: "Quant de temps triga?", a: "Els terminis varien segons el projecte. Proporcionem un temps estimat específic amb cada pressupost. Per exemple, edicions simples poden trigar 24-48 hores, mentre que el desenvolupament web triga 1-2 setmanes." },
          { q: "Com funcionen les revisions?", a: "Els nostres pressupostos inclouen un nombre fix de rondes de revisió (típicament 2). Definim clarament què compta com a revisió per assegurar que assolim els teus objectius sense canvis d'abast." },
          { q: "Quina informació necessiteu per començar?", a: "Necessitem un resum clar: què vols, exemples d'estil que t'agradin i la teva data límit. Com més específic siguis, més ràpid podrem lliurar." },
          { q: "Puc parlar amb el freelancer directament?", a: "No, Kazi gestiona el lliurament. Per assegurar qualitat, velocitat i resolució de disputes, tota comunicació passa a través del teu gestor de projectes dedicat de Kazi." },
        ],
        payments: [
          { q: "Com funcionen els pagaments?", a: "Fem servir un sistema de fites. Pagues un dipòsit inicial per començar el treball, i el saldo restant es paga només quan aproves la vista prèvia final. Per a clients a Espanya, acceptem Bizum, transferència bancària i targetes." },
          { q: "Oferiu reemborsaments?", a: "Sí. Oferim un reemborsament gratuït fins a 5 dies després de completar el servei si el problema es deu a un error del freelancer que no podemos arreglar." },
        ],
        privacy: [
          { q: "Com protegiu la confidencialitat?", a: "Els freelancers no veuen les teves dades personals més enllà del necessari per fer la feina. Tot el nostre talent signa acords de confidencialitat estrictes per protegir la teva propietat intel·lectual." },
          { q: "Què passa si desapareixo a meitat del projecte?", a: "Si no respons per un període perllongat, pausarem el projecte. Si no podem contactar-te després de múltiples intents, ens reservem el dret de tancar el projecte i facturar pel treball completat fins a la data." },
