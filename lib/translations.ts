      questions: {
        general: [
          { q: "What is Kazi?", a: "Kazi is a digital service agency. You send your request, we match it to the right specialist, we manage the work, and we deliver a quality-checked result on time. You deal with one point of contact from start to finish." },
          { q: "How long does it take?", a: "Timelines depend on scope and your deadline. Most small requests take 24 to 72 hours. Larger projects, like full websites or long documents, follow a clear schedule shared after you submit your quote request. If you need something urgently, choose an urgent deadline and we will confirm feasibility before starting." },
          { q: "How do revisions work?", a: "Every project includes a set number of revisions, confirmed in your quote. Revisions cover improvements to the agreed scope, like layout tweaks, wording refinement, or minor feature adjustments. New requests or added scope get quoted separately so timelines and quality stay protected." },
          { q: "What info do you need to start?", a: "We need four basics: Service type, Deadline, Budget range, and a Clear brief. If you have examples, brand assets, files, or links, upload them in the quote form. The clearer your brief, the faster and better the result." },
          { q: "Can I talk to the freelancer directly?", a: "To keep delivery smooth and accountable, communication goes through Kazi. We collect your requirements, manage updates, and ensure quality control. If a call is needed for clarity, we can arrange a short call, but we keep one official channel so nothing gets lost and timelines stay tight." },
          { q: "Do you guarantee deadlines?", a: "We only accept deadlines we can meet. Once we confirm your project, we commit to the timeline. If a delay happens due to us, we prioritize a fix, fast-track the delivery, or agree on a fair adjustment." },
          { q: "What counts as “scope”?", a: "Scope is what you requested and what we confirmed in your quote. Anything outside that scope is treated as a new request and quoted separately to protect quality and timelines." },
          { q: "Do you work on exams or timed tests?", a: "No. We do not support live exams, timed tests, or any request designed to cheat. We support learning, editing, and legitimate project assistance." },
          { q: "Can you help with academic work?", a: "Yes, for academic services we focus on editing, clarity, structure, formatting, referencing support, and tutoring. You remain responsible for final submission and academic integrity rules at your institution." },
          { q: "What if I’m not sure what I need?", a: "Submit a quote with your goal and deadline. We will recommend the best service option and next steps before you pay." },
        ],
        payments: [
          { q: "How do payments work?", a: "We confirm your quote first. Then you pay to start the project. For larger projects, we split into milestones, for example 50 percent to start and 50 percent on delivery, or milestone-based payments. Payment options depend on your location and project size, and will be shown during checkout or confirmed in your quote." },
          { q: "Do you offer refunds?", a: "If we have not started, you can request a cancellation and we will refund minus any payment processing fees. If work has started, refunds depend on the stage of the project and what has already been delivered. If you are unhappy, we first try to fix it through revisions or partial rework. We do not refund completed work that matches the agreed brief, but we do stand behind quality and fairness." },
        ],
        privacy: [
          { q: "How do you protect confidentiality?", a: "We treat your files and information as confidential. Access is limited to the team members working on your project. We do not sell or share your data. On request, we can sign an NDA for business projects." },
          { q: "What happens if I disappear mid-project?", a: "If you stop replying, we pause the project and hold your files. After 14 days of no response, the project is marked inactive. If you return later, we will resume from the last confirmed step, but timelines may change based on workload. For long inactivity, a restart fee may apply if the project needs re-planning." },
          { q: "Will my project be original?", a: "Yes. All work is created for you based on your brief. If you request academic support, we focus on improving your draft and helping you present your ideas clearly." },

      questions: {
        general: [
          { q: "¿Qué es Kazi?", a: "Kazi es una agencia de servicios digitales. Envías tu solicitud, la asignamos al especialista adecuado, gestionamos el trabajo y entregamos un resultado con control de calidad y a tiempo. Tratas con un único punto de contacto de principio a fin." },
          { q: "¿Cuánto tiempo toma?", a: "Los plazos dependen del alcance y de tu fecha límite. La mayoría de las solicitudes pequeñas tardan de 24 a 72 horas. Los proyectos más grandes, como sitios web completos o documentos extensos, siguen un cronograma claro que se comparte después de enviar tu solicitud de presupuesto. Si necesitas algo urgente, elige una fecha límite urgente y confirmaremos la viabilidad antes de comenzar." },
          { q: "¿Cómo funcionan las revisiones?", a: "Cada proyecto incluye un número determinado de revisiones, confirmado en tu presupuesto. Las revisiones cubren mejoras al alcance acordado, como ajustes de diseño, refinamiento de redacción o pequeños ajustes de funciones. Las nuevas solicitudes o el alcance añadido se presupuestan por separado para proteger los plazos y la calidad." },
          { q: "¿Qué información necesitan para empezar?", a: "Necesitamos cuatro básicos: Tipo de servicio, Fecha límite, Rango de presupuesto y un Resumen claro. Si tienes ejemplos, activos de marca, archivos o enlaces, súbelos en el formulario de presupuesto. Cuanto más claro sea tu resumen, más rápido y mejor será el resultado." },
          { q: "¿Puedo hablar con el freelancer directamente?", a: "Para mantener la entrega fluida y responsable, toda la comunicación pasa por Kazi. Recopilamos tus requisitos, gestionamos las actualizaciones y garantizamos el control de calidad. Si se necesita una llamada para mayor claridad, podemos organizarla, pero mantenemos un canal oficial para que nada se pierda y los plazos se cumplan." },
          { q: "¿Garantizan los plazos?", a: "Solo aceptamos plazos que podemos cumplir. Una vez que confirmamos tu proyecto, nos comprometemos con el cronograma. Si ocurre un retraso por nuestra parte, priorizamos una solución, aceleramos la entrega o acordamos un ajuste justo." },
          { q: "¿Qué cuenta como “alcance”?", a: "El alcance es lo que solicitaste y lo que confirmamos en tu presupuesto. Cualquier cosa fuera de ese alcance se trata como una nueva solicitud y se presupuesta por separado para proteger la calidad y los plazos." },
          { q: "¿Trabajan en exámenes o pruebas cronometradas?", a: "No. No apoyamos exámenes en vivo, pruebas cronometradas ni ninguna solicitud diseñada para hacer trampa. Apoyamos el aprendizaje, la edición y la asistencia legítima en proyectos." },
          { q: "¿Pueden ayudar con el trabajo académico?", a: "Sí, para los servicios académicos nos enfocamos en la edición, claridad, estructura, formato, soporte de referencias y tutoría. Sigues siendo responsable de la entrega final y de las reglas de integridad académica de tu institución." },
          { q: "¿Qué pasa si no estoy seguro de lo que necesito?", a: "Envía un presupuesto con tu objetivo y fecha límite. Te recomendaremos la mejor opción de servicio y los siguientes pasos antes de que pagues." },
        ],
        payments: [
          { q: "¿Cómo funcionan los pagos?", a: "Primero confirmamos tu presupuesto. Luego pagas para comenzar el proyecto.

        general: [
          { q: "Què és Kazi?", a: "Kazi és una agència de serveis digitals. Envies la teva sol·licitud, l'assignem a l'especialista adequat, gestionem el treball i lliurem un resultat amb control de qualitat i a temps. Tractes amb un únic punt de contacte de principi a fi." },
          { q: "Quant de temps triga?", a: "Els terminis depenen de l'abast i de la teva data límit. La majoria de les sol·licituds petites triguen de 24 a 72 hores. Els projectes més grans, com llocs web complets o documents extensos, segueixen un cronograma clar que es comparteix després d'enviar la teva sol·licitud de pressupost. Si necessites alguna cosa urgent, tria una data límit urgent i confirmarem la viabilitat abans de començar." },
          { q: "Com funcionen les revisions?", a: "Cada projecte inclou un nombre determinat de revisions, confirmat en el teu pressupost. Les revisions cobreixen millores a l'abast acordat, com ajustos de disseny, refinament de redacció o petits ajustos de funcions. Les noves sol·licituds o l'abast afegit es pressuposten per separat per protegir els terminis i la qualitat." },
          { q: "Quina informació necessiteu per començar?", a: "Necessitem quatre bàsics: Tipus de servei, Data límit, Rang de pressupost i un Resum clar. Si tens exemples, actius de marca, arxius o enllaços, puja'ls al formulari de pressupost. Com més clar sigui el teu resum, més ràpid i millor serà el resultat." },
          { q: "Puc parlar amb el freelancer directament?", a: "Per mantenir el lliurament fluid i responsable, tota la comunicació passa per Kazi. Recollim els teus requisits, gestionem les actualitzacions i garantim el control de qualitat. Si es necessita una trucada per a més claredat, la podem organitzar, però mantenim un canal oficial perquè res es perdi i els terminis es compleixin." },
          { q: "Garantiu els terminis?", a: "Només acceptem terminis que podem complir. Una vegada que confirmem el teu projecte, ens comprometem amb el cronograma. Si ocorre un retard per la nostra part, prioritzem una solució, accelerem el lliurament o acordem un ajust just." },
          { q: "Què compta com a “abast”?", a: "L'abast és el que vas sol·licitar i el que vam confirmar en el teu pressupost. Qualsevol cosa fora d'aquest abast es tracta com una nova sol·licitud i es pressuposta per separat per protegir la qualitat i els terminis." },
          { q: "Treballeu en exàmens o proves cronometrades?", a: "No. No donem suport a exàmens en viu, proves cronometrades ni cap sol·licitud dissenyada per fer trampa. Donem suport a l'aprenentatge, l'edició i l'assistència legítima en projectes." },
          { q: "Podeu ajudar amb el treball acadèmic?", a: "Sí, per als serveis acadèmics ens enfoquem en l'edició, claredat, estructura, format, suport de referències i tutoria. Continues sent responsable del lliurament final i de les regles d'integritat acadèmica de la teva institució." },
          { q: "Què passa si no estic segur del que necessito?", a: "Envia un pressupost amb el teu objectiu i data límit. Et recomanarem la millor opció de servei i els següents passos abans que paguis." },
        ],
        payments: [
          { q: "Com funcionen els pagaments?", a: "Primer confirmem el teu pressupost. Després pagues per començar el projecte. Per a projectes més grans, dividim en fites, per exemple, 50% per començar i 50% en el lliurament, o pagaments basats en fites. Les opcions de pagament depenen de la teva ubicació i mida del projecte, i es mostraran durant el pagament o es confirmaran en el teu pressupost." },
          { q: "Oferiu reemborsaments?", a: "Si no hem començat, pots sol·licitar una cancel·lació i et retornarem els diners menys les tarifes de processament de pagament. Si el treball ha començat, els reemborsaments depenen de l'etapa del projecte i del que ja s'hagi lliurat. Si no estàs satisfet, primer intentem solucionar-ho mitjançant revisions. No reemborsarem el treball completat que coincidi amb el resum acordat, però garantim qualitat i equitat." },
        ],
        privacy: [
          { q: "Com protegiu la confidencialitat?", a: "Tractem els teus fitxers i informació com a confidencials. L'accés està limitat als membres de l'equip que treballen en el teu projecte. No venem ni compartim les teves dades. Sota petició, podem signar un acord de confidencialitat (NDA) per a projectes empresarials." },
          { q: "Què passa si desaparec a meitat del projecte?", a: "Si deixes de respondre, pausem el projecte i guardem els teus fitxers. Després de 14 dies sense resposta, el projecte es marca com a inactiu. Si tornes més tard, reprendrem des de l'últim pas confirmat, però els terminis poden canviar. Per a inactivitat prolongada, pot aplicar-se una tarifa de reinici." },
          { q: "Serà el meu projecte original?", a: "Sí. Tot el treball es crea per a tu segons el teu resum. Si sol·licites suport acadèmic, ens enfoquem en millorar el teu esborrany i ajudar-te a presentar les teves idees amb claredat." },
