You'll just receive booking notifications on your mobile or WhatsApp. Plus, we'll give you a quick 15-minute training so you know how to view your calendar and block dates. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use our system." },
          { q: "How long until my website is ready?", a: "Usually, between 7 and 14 days after you give us the go-ahead. We work fast so you can start getting bookings as soon as possible." },
          { q: "Are you a real agency or an internet robot?", a: "We're real and local. Our base is in Castellar del Vallès (Barcelona). We understand the local market because we live here, shop here, and get our hair cut here." },
          { q: "I already have a domain or an old website. Can we use it?", a: "Yes. If you already have a domain, we'll connect it to the new system. If you have an old website that isn't bringing you customers, we'll completely renew it to make it modern and accept automatic bookings." },

        payments: [
          { q: "Do I have to pay everything upfront?", a: "No. We understand how local businesses work. We charge a startup fee to set up the website and system, then a small monthly fee for maintenance. Check our pricing page for the exact options." },
          { q: "What does the monthly fee include?", a: "The monthly fee is your 'Peace of Mind Insurance.' It includes web hosting, your domain name (e.g. tuberberia.com), backups, and technical support. If something breaks or you need to change a price on the website, we handle it." },
          { q: "Is there a contract or minimum commitment?", a: "We want you to stay because the system works, not because we force you. You can cancel the monthly service with 30 days notice. You own your business." },

We handle strategy, content, posting, and community so the brand looks consistent, sells more, and stays active without the owner thinking about it. First reference client is Estanc Ramoneda, so the service is built for retail, product promos, and local foot-traffic.\n\n**Goals**\n1. Make the page look premium and consistent so new visitors trust the business fast.\n2. Increase local discovery, reach, and profile visits.\n3. Turn attention into actions: DMs, calls, WhatsApp clicks, and in-store visits.\n4. Keep posting consistent every week, with clear promos and seasonal moments.\n5. Track performance monthly and adjust based on what performs, not vibes.\n\n**Key Results**\n• **Custom Grid Aesthetic:** Templates for posts, stories, highlights, and promo layouts so the feed stays coherent.\n• **Weekly Content Plan:** A simple calendar with planned promos, product features, and seasonal posts.\n• **Daily Stories:** Stories that push action like 'ask in DM', 'visit today', or 'new arrivals'.\n• **Reels System:** Repeatable reel formats for product showcases and new stock drops.\n• **Monthly Reporting:** Tracking reach, engagement, and DMs to decide what to double down on.",
